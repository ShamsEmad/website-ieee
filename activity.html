                <h4>Recruitment</h4>
                <p>
                  Each Year, We Need To Recruit New Members. Student Branches
                  Are Only As Strong As Their Members. We Try To Attract New
                  Members By Setting Up A Big Media Campaign On Our Social
                  Platforms And Making Booths To Introduce People To The World
                  Of Being An IEEEian. It Is Important To Clearly Outline The
                  Organizationâ€™s Purpose And Succinctly Describe What The
                  Organization Stands For And What It Does. Being Transparent
                  About The Who, The What, And When Helps Attract Potential
                  Members Interested In Working For The Benefit Of The Branch.
                  Providing Examples Of Past Achievements And Strategic Goals Is
                  Also A Great Way To Engage Prospective Recruits. At IEEE BUB,
                  We Serve An Educational And Social Function. We Provide
                  Members With The Opportunity To Build A Sense Of Belonging And
                  Engage With Our Campus.

                  Them For The Leading Positions. We Provide Them With Trainings
                  And Sessions Designed To Develop Their Talents, Skills And

                <p>
                  Week 4 & 5 Interviews:- In This Phase, We Interview New
                  Members To Identify Their Technical And Non-Technical
                  Knowledge And Determine How And Where They Acquired This
                  Knowledge. We Also Investigate Their Direct And Indirect
                  Knowledge And Their Previous Experiences. We Also Ask
                  Open-Ended Questions, Politely Challenge The Interviewee, And
                  Embrace Pauses And Silence, Giving Interviewees Time To Think.
                  After Examining Their Skills, Scrutinizing Their Behavior And
                  Attitude, And Many Other Aspects That Are Required To Fulfill
                  Our Student Branch Needs, We Go Through The Filtration Process
                  And Send Acceptance Or Rejection Mails To All Candidates.

                <p>
                  Week 6 Welcome Party ( Opening ) :- A Good Orientation Day
                  Helps The New Members Feel Excited About What They Are Going
                  To Do And Achieve. We Organize This Event Every Year To
                  Provide A Social Gathering (Orientation Day) For All The
                  Newcomers To Make Them More Comfortable With The Place And
                  Provide Them With More Information About Us And Our Mission.
                  All Of This Helps Them Adapt Faster And Contribute More.
                  During The Day, The New Board Represents Themselves And Their
                  Plans And Goals, And Gets To Know New Members. We Also Review
                  The Progress Of The Previous Year Through A Video That
                  Represents All Our Achievements And Progress.

                <p>
                  To Carry Out A Successful Event, We Must Focus On The Planning
                  Stage, This Is The Most Important Stage To Achieve The
                  Proposed Objectives. It Is Necessary To Visualize What We Want
                  To Achieve, Without This We Will Not Be Able To Measure The
                  Results And Verify That The Proposed Objective Was Achieved.
                  In The Planning Process, The Audience To Whom We Are Directing
                  Our Event Is Considered, What Motivates Them And What Does
                  Not, What Their Needs Are And How Our Event Fits In With This.
                  No Matter The Type Of Event We Are Organizing, Or The Way In
                  Which We Reach The Participants, Planning Is The Only
                  Guarantee Of Success.

                  Technology, Like Programming, Startups, Web Development,
                  Graphic Design, Mobile Development, And Talk About CV. These
                  Topics Were Represented By Brilliant Presenters. It Was Held
                  On February 26. We Did A Big Media Campaign On Our Different
